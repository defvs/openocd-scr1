	1: Read from @c address. (read)

	When the debugger reads this field, it means the following:

	0: The previous operation completed successfully.

	1: Reserved.

	2: A previous operation failed.  The data scanned into @c dmi in
	this access will be ignored.  This status is sticky and can be
	cleared by writing @c dmireset in @c dtmcs.

	This indicates that the DM itself responded with an error.
	Note: there are no specified cases in which the DM would
	respond with an error, and DMI is not required to support
	returning errors.

	3: An operation was attempted while a DMI request is still in
	progress. The data scanned into @c dmi in this access will be
	ignored. This status is sticky and can be cleared by writing
	@c dmireset in @c dtmcs. If a debugger sees this status, it
	needs to give the target more TCK edges between Update-DR and
	Capture-DR. The simplest way to do that is to add extra transitions
	in Run-Test/Idle.

	(The DTM, DM, and/or component may be in different clock domains,
	so synchronization may be required. Some relatively fixed number of
	TCK ticks may be needed for the request to reach the DM, complete,
	and for the response to be synchronized back into the TCK domain.)

	1: The action for this trigger will be taken after the instruction
	that triggered it is executed. It should be taken before the next
	instruction is executed, but it is better to implement triggers and
	not implement that suggestion than to not implement them at all.

	Most hardware will only implement one timing or the other, possibly
	dependent on @c select, @c execute, @c load, and @c store.
	This bit primarily exists for the hardware to communicate to the debugger
	what will happen. Hardware may implement the bit fully writable, in
	which case the debugger has a little more control.

	Data load triggers with @c timing of 0 will result in the same load
	happening again when the debugger lets the hart run. For data load
	triggers, debuggers must first attempt to set the breakpoint with
	@c timing of 1.

	A chain of triggers that don't all have the same @c timing value
	will never fire (unless consecutive instructions match the
	appropriate triggers).

0: When this trigger matches, the configured action is taken.

1: While this trigger does not match, it prevents the trigger with
the next index from matching.

Because @c chain affects the next trigger, hardware must zero it in
writes to @c mcontrol that set @c dmode to 0 if the next trigger has
@c dmode of 1.

In addition hardware should ignore writes to @c mcontrol that set
@c dmode to 1 if the previous trigger has both @c dmode of 0 and
@c chain of 1. Debuggers must avoid the latter case by checking
@c chain on the previous trigger if they're writing @c mcontrol.

Implementations that wish to limit the maximum length of a trigger
chain (e.g. to meet timing requirements) may do so by zeroing
@c chain in writes to @c mcontrol that would make the chain too long.
